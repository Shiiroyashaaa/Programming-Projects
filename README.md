# Programming-Projects

I majored in Computer Science at UWRF. We were taught how to code in Java. I took this opportunity to write my assignments in different languages. So far I've written some of the assignments in C and in Python. I haven't finished writing all of the assignments in different languages but I've got somewhat kind of far. I hope to finish them soon.
